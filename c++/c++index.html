            <h1 id="plusaboutHead">C++ Programming Language</h1>
            <p class="basicAnswer">C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an
                extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly
                over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to
                facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language,
                and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel,
                Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.</p>
            <p class="betDec">C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained
                software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design
                highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software
                infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games,
                servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g.
                telephone switches or space probes)</p>
            <p class="mainCode">Let's first try to understand the concept of Object-Oriented programming language - </p>
            <h3 id="plusaboutHead">Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
            <p class="basicAnswer">Concepts of Object-oriented programming includes - </p>
            <p class="basicAnswer">1. Objects</p>
            <p class="basicAnswer">2. Classes</p>
            <p class="basicAnswer">3. Data abstraction and encapsulation</p>
            <p class="basicAnswer">4. Inheritance</p>
            <p class="basicAnswer">5. Polymorphism</p>
            <p class="basicAnswer">6. Dynamic Binding</p>
            <h4 class="plusheading">Objects</h4>
            <p class="basicAnswer">Objects are the basic run-time entities in an object-oriented system.They may represent a person, a place, a bank account, a table of data or any item that the program has to handle.</p>
            <p class="basicAnswer">They may also represent user-defined data such as vectors, time and lists.Programming problem is analyzed in terms of objects and the nature of communication between them.</p>
            <p class="noteLine">Objects take up space in the memory and have an associated address like a record in Pascal, or a structure in C.</p>
            <h4 class="plusheading">Classes</h4>
            <p class="basicAnswer">As objects contain data, and code to manipulate that data. The entire set of data and code of an object can
                be made a user-defined data type with the help of a class.In fact objects are variable of the type class,once 
                a class has been defined, we can create any number of objects belonging to that class.A class is thus a
                collection of objects of similar type. For example:- potato, tomato are members of the class vegetables. 
                Classes are user defined data type and behave like the built-in types of a programming languages. The 
                syntax used to create an object is no different then the syntax used to create an integer object in C. if 
                vegetable has been defined as class,then the statement</p>
                <p class="basicAnswer">&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvegetable potato;</p>
                <p class="basicAnswer">will create an object "potato" belonging to the class "vegetable".</p>
                <h4 class="plusheading">Data abstraction and encapsulation</h4>
                <p class="betDec">The wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit (called class) is known as "encapsulation". Data 
                    encapsulation is the most striking feature of a class. </p>
                   <p> <a href="/plusDataAbstraction">Know more about Data Abstraction -></a></p>
                <p class="betDec">Abstraction is te representation of essential features without including the background details or explanations.</p>
               <p><a href="plusencapsulation">Know more about Encapsulation -></a></p>
               <h4 class="plusheading">Inheritance</h4>
               <p class="basicAnswer">Inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of object of another class.
                It supports the concept of hierarchical classification"</p>
                <p><a href="/plusinheritance">Know more about Inheritance -></a></p>
                <h4 class="plusheading">Polymorphism</h4>
                <p class="basicAnswer">Polymorphism means the ability to take more than one form. An operation may exhibit different behaviours 
                    in different instances.</p>
                    <p><a href="/pluspolymorphism">Know more about Polymorphism -></a></p>
                    <h4 class="plusheading">Dynamic Binding</h4>
                    <p class="basicAnswer">Binding refers to the linking of a procedure call to the code to be executed in response to the call.</p>
